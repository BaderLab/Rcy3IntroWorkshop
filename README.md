# Workshop Description

Cytoscape is one of the most popular applications for network analysis and visualization. In this workshop, we will demonstrate new capabilities to integrate Cytoscape into programmatic workflows and pipelines using R. We will begin with an overview of network biology themes and concepts, and then we will translate these into Cytoscape terms for practical applications. The bulk of the workshop will be a hands-on demonstration of accessing and controlling Cytoscape from R to perform a network analysis of tumor expression data.

## Pre-requisites

### Workshop prerequisites:
* Basic knowledge of R syntax
* Basic knowledge of Cytoscape software
* Familiarity with network biology concepts

### Background:
* “How to visually interpret biological data using networks.” Merico D, Gfeller D, Bader GD. Nature Biotechnology 2009 Oct 27, 921-924 - http://baderlab.org/Publications?action=AttachFile&do=view&target=2009_Merico_Primer_NatBiotech_Oct.pdf
